This code provides all the steps that were used for producing the figures and the tables of the paper Scaling intrinsic Gaussian Markov random field (IGMRFs) priors in two dimensions. Describes the structure for each type of IGMRFs in one and two dimensions. 

Analytically, we describe how the precision matrices of the one-dimensional 1st and 2nd order and two-dimensional second order IGMRFs (or random walk) are formed/presented changing each time the number of nodes. For the two-dimensional second order IGMRF four different precision matrices are presented. Based on the precision matrices and the number of nodes we show the generalised covariance matrix, $\Sigma^*$ and the calculations for the reference standard deviation. 
The focus on the paper is the proper scaling in standard deviation in prior distributions when the IGMRFs change either order or dimension. Therefore, having the initial standard deviation, b we first define the Upper levels for the one-dimensional 1st and 2nd order IGMRFs as well as for the 4 different types of two-dimensional second order IGMRFs in order to proceed to the scaling of the standard deviation for each case getting a new b value. 

Finally, we present four specific values of b that were used in previous analysis for blood pressure data and we show what is the new scaling for the two-dimensional equivalent. 
All the calculations for producing the matrices and plots presented in the paper are shown in the code.
