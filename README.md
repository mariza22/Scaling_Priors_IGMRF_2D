# Scaling_Priors_IGMRF_2D
We describe how we can scale prior distribution for a two-dimensional Intrinsic Gaussian Markov Random Field(IGMRF) model. We make comparison between the one-dimensional and two dimensional IGMRFs and also we compare different kinds of two-dimensional IGMRF. Application in blood pressure data is shown.
