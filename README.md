This code provides all the steps that were used for producing the figures and the tables of the paper Scaling intrinsic Gaussian Markov  random field priors in two dimensions. Describes the structure for each type of IGMRFs in one and two dimensions. 

Analytically, we describe how the precision matrices of the one-dimensional 1st order and 2nd order  and two-dimensional second order random walks are presented changing each time the number of nodes. Based on the precision matrices and the number of nodes we show the generalised covariance matrix, Sigma* and the calculations for the reference standard deviation. Afterwards, having the initial standard deviation, b we define the Upper levels for the one-dimensional  1st and 2nd order random walk as well as for the 4 different types of two-dimensional second order random walk in order to proceed to the scaling of the standard deviation for each case getting a new b value. We also present how the scaling of standard deiation changes for different values of standard deviation. All the calculations for producing the matrices and plots presented in the paper are shown in the code.
