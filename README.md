# Scaling_Priors_IGMRF_2D
We describe how we can scale prior distribution for a two-dimensional Intrinsic Gaussian Markov Random Field( IGMRF) model. Choosing different number of nodes (or years ), we make comparison between the one-dimensional and two-dimensional IGMRFs and also we compare different kinds of two-dimensional IGMRF together. All the calculations for producing the matrices and plots presented in the paper are shown. Application in blood pressure data is shown.
In this repository you can find code for both the one dimensional and two dimensional IGMRF for a better understanding of the ideas.
